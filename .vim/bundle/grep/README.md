grep
====

Plugin to integrate Grep search tools with Vim

The grep plugin integrates the grep, fgrep, egrep, and agrep tools with
Vim and allows you to search for a pattern in one or more files and jump
to them. 

To use this plugin, you need the grep, fgrep, egrep, agrep, find and
xargs utilities. These tools are present in most of the Unix
installations.  For MS-Windows systems, you can download the GNU grep
and find utilities from the following sites:
